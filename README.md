### 2. Bored:

- **Returns**: A random activity according to the params.

## Tech Immplementation:
- [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com) is used to get an activity from the wide range of activities it provides.
- Why Bored API? Because it has a huge collection of activities which are updated regularly and are sorted well in different types.
- It also provides links for some activities.
- Next we use OpenAi [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint to generate a show few words description for the user.
- The prompt we use is: `Given activity, elaborate a bit in max 2 sentences about it. \n Activity: <Activity> \n Suggestion:`
- Next to generate image we again use same completions api to get image description. The prompt is: `Covert given activity into a description of an image in few words that can be used as a prompt to a text to image model. \n Activity: <Activity> \n Image Description:`
- Then the image description that we get is used to generate an image using [open journey](https://openjourney.art)
